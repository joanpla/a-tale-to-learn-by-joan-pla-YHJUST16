The princess cried all night by the big blue lake. In the early morning, as the beautiful, warm sun was rising, she saw a shining frog by the shore. 
"Let's try just one final frog", she thought. So she gently took it by the hand and kissed it. Nothing happened. 
A tear was coming from her eye but, suddenly, the frog jumped and exploded in a magic cloud. When it vanished there he was: 
a tall and handsome prince and his sidekick, a small white cat.
