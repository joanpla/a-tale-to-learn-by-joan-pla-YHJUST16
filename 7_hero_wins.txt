"What can I do?" told the prince to the sky. Nobody answered. A bird that was flying heard the lament and stopped by. That bird, a nightingale, was very wise and old. 
It had travelled through the whole wide world so he knew a lot of remedies. "Hey, prince, don't worry", said the nightingale, "I know a magic recipe: 
mix some milk with honey from Namibia, thyme from Himalaya and an aspirin, and everything will be ok". The nightingale was right. All of a sudden, out of nowhere and ate the bird. The prince felt bad but prepared the prescription and gave it to the princess. The next day she was full recovered.
"I think it was the Himalaya's thime", said the prince. "Don't be silly", answered the princess, giggling "It was the aspirin".
