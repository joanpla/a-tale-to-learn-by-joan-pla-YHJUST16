However, the princess was still ill. "What can I do?" told the prince to the sky. Nobody answered. A bird that was flying heard 
the lament and stopped by. That bird, a nightingale, was very old and wise. It had travelled through the whole world so it knew a lot of

thyme from Himalaya and an aspirin, and everything will be ok". 
The prince prepared the prescription and gave it to the princess. The next day she was full recovered.
"I think it was the Himalaya's thime", said the prince. "Don't be nave", answered the princess: "It was the fucking aspirin!".
"Wow! There's no need to swear!", replied the prince upset. But the princess kissed him and he forgot about everything.
