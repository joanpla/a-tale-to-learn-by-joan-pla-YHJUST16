"What can I do?" told the prince to the sky. Nobody answered. A bird that was flying heard the lament and stopped by. That bird, a nightingale, was very wise. 
It had travelled through the whole world so he knew a lot of remedies. "Hey, prince, don't worry", said the nightingale, "I know a magic recipe: 
mix some milk with honey from Namibia, thyme from Himalaya and an aspirin, and everything will be ok". The nightingale was right. The prince prepared the prescription and gave it to the princess. The next day she was full recovered.
"I think it was the Himalaya's thime", said the prince. "Don't be silly", answered the princess, "It was the aspirin".
