Once upon a time somewhere in Sweden, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, 
there was a beautiful young girl who kissed all the frogs he found, hoping one of them would 
transform into a prince. 
But after five years, she was beginning to get tired of kissing nasty frogs since they are kind of slimy.
