Spring, summer and autumm went by. All the leaves had fallen from the trees and a frozen wind started to blow. 
The princess got cold they needed to stop in a cozy cave. 
"Two days of rest and everything will be OK", thought the prince, but after one week the princess got fever
and became very weak. Then the prince suddenly remembered that he had made an apple pie. He pulled it out from 
his bag only to be devoured instantely by the princess. The prince cried out: "What the fuck! I'm hungry too,
why didn't you leave some for me!!!". Then the princess kissed him and he forgot about everything.
