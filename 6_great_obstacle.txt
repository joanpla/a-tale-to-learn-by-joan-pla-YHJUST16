Spring, summer and autumm went by. 
All the leaves had fallen from the trees and a frozen wind started to blow. 

The princess got cold so they stopped in a cozy cave. 
"Two days of rest and everything will be OK", 
thought the prince, but after one week the princess got fever
and was very weak. 
but then the prince suddenly remembered that he had made an apple pie.
He pulled it out from his bag only to be devoured instantely by the princess.
The prince cried out: but i'm hungry as well , why didn't you leave som for me !!!
