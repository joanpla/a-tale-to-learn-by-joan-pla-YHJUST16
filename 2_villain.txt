One day an evil wizard saw her trying to kiss all those frogs, 
hoping that they would turn into a prince. 
He thought to himself: I'm evil so i'm going to make the next frog
she kisses into a prince only to make her sick and die within two weeks. 
It was a genoius plan. 
but on the other hand the wizard also had an super evil pet that was just waiting to take 
a bite from the lovely princess.
