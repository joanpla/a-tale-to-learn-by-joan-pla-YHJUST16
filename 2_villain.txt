One day an ugly and old evil wizard saw her trying to kiss all those disgusting frogs, hoping that they would turn into a prince. 

He thought to himself: "I'm so evil that I'm going to transform the next frog she kisses into a prince that suffers a contagious illness 
that will make her sick and die within two weeks". It was a genius plan. He also had a bazooka and a chicken just in case the plan A didn't work.
